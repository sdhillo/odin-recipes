<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>salt and fresh ground pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¾ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or more to taste</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breast halves between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet on high heat until it begins to shimmer, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium; cook chicken breasts until browned and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked chicken to a warm plate and loosely cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the skillet; stir in flour and cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan; cook and stir until gravy begins to simmer and thicken, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in green onions and chipotle chile powder.</li>
        <li>Return chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooks' Notes</h4>
    <p>May substitute chicken stock for chicken broth. For thinner gravy, add more broth or stock.</p>
